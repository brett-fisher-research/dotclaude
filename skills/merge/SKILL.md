# Merge the pull request

Final step of the PR workflow (`/pr` → `/raise` → **`/merge`**). Run only when the user has reviewed
the PR and is happy with it. The user prefers a **squash merge** so the base gets exactly one commit
per PR.

This skill is self-contained git/gh only — it knows nothing about issue trackers. (If the work is
tracked in Linear, `/linear` marks the ticket Done after this runs.)

## Steps

1. **Resolve the base + identify the PR.** Base = `--base <branch>` from `$ARGUMENTS`, else `main`.
   Use the PR for the current branch (or the number in `$ARGUMENTS`):
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number,title,state,mergeStateStatus,headRefName,baseRefName
   ```
   - If it isn't open, stop and report (maybe already merged, or never raised — `/raise`).
   - If checks/mergeability are blocking, surface that to the user rather than force-merging.
   - Sanity: `baseRefName` should match the resolved base.

2. **Squash-merge** and delete the branch (squash = single commit on the base):
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
   ```
   `--delete-branch` removes both the remote and local branch.

3. **Return to the base and pull the latest** so the local repo has the squashed commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout <base>
   git pull --ff-only
   ```

4. **Confirm.** Show the result: `git log --oneline -3`. Report that the PR is merged, the branch is
   cleaned up, and we're back on an up-to-date base — ready for the next `/pr`.
